# LayerOne 2025 GLiTCh BadgE - Hardware Security Case Studies

This directory contains case studies of real-world hardware security vulnerabilities and how they can be explored using the LayerOne 2025 GLiTCh BadgE. These case studies provide practical examples of the techniques described in the main documentation.

## Available Case Studies

### [nRF52 Glitch Attack](nrf52_glitch_attack.md)

A detailed examination of the voltage glitching vulnerability discovered in Nordic Semiconductor's nRF52 series of Bluetooth Low Energy SoCs. This case study covers:

- Background on the nRF52 and its security features
- Technical details of the vulnerability
- Step-by-step procedure for reproducing the attack with the GLiTCh BadgE
- Analysis of why the attack works
- Countermeasures and lessons learned

## Purpose of Case Studies

These case studies serve several important purposes:

1. **Educational Value**: They provide concrete examples of hardware security concepts
2. **Practical Application**: They demonstrate how to apply the badge's features to real-world scenarios
3. **Research Guidance**: They offer methodologies that can be adapted to other targets
4. **Documentation Examples**: They show how to document hardware security research effectively

## Responsible Use

The information in these case studies is provided for educational and research purposes only. When reproducing these attacks or applying similar techniques to other devices:

1. Only test devices you own or have explicit permission to test
2. Follow responsible disclosure practices if you discover new vulnerabilities
3. Consider the legal and ethical implications of your research
4. Document your findings thoroughly and accurately

## Contributing Case Studies

We welcome contributions of additional case studies. If you've used the LayerOne 2025 GLiTCh BadgE to explore hardware security vulnerabilities, consider documenting your work and submitting it as a case study.

Guidelines for case study submissions:

1. Follow the format of existing case studies
2. Include clear setup instructions specific to the GLiTCh BadgE
3. Provide background information on the target device
4. Document the attack procedure in detail
5. Include analysis of why the attack works
6. Discuss countermeasures and lessons learned
7. Cite references and prior work appropriately

## Planned Future Case Studies

We plan to add more case studies covering:

- Glitching attacks on secure bootloaders
- Power analysis of cryptographic implementations
- Fault injection in smart cards
- Clock glitching techniques
- Combined glitching and side-channel attacks
